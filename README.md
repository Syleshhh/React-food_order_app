Yummy is a modern web-based food ordering application built using React.js, React Router DOM, Redux, and hooks like useState, useEffect, and useContext. 
The application utilizes the Swiggy API to fetch restaurant data, menu items, and user reviews. 
It offers features such as top rating, searching by name, adding items to cart, and accordion navigation for improved user experience.

Notes:using a CORS extension to access data from the Swiggy API in your application during development.

Key Features:

Restaurant Listings: Fetch restaurant listings from the Swiggy API and display them in a visually appealing manner. Utilize useState and useEffect hooks to manage restaurant data state and fetch data asynchronously.

Top Rating Section: Implement a section to showcase top-rated restaurants or dishes based on user ratings. Utilize useEffect hook to fetch and update top-rated items dynamically.

Search Functionality: Allow users to search for specific restaurants or dishes by name. Implement a search feature that utilizes useState and useEffect hooks to manage search state and display relevant results.

Add to Cart: Enable users to add items to their cart with a simple click. Utilize Redux to manage cart state, including adding. Provide a visually appealing UI to display the cart contents.

Accordion Navigation: Utilize accordion elements to organize restaurant menus or categories for easy navigation. Implement accordion functionality using useState hook to expand and collapse menu sections.

Technical Implementation:

React.js: Utilize React.js for building the frontend user interface, creating reusable components, and managing component state using hooks like useState and useEffect.

React Router DOM: Implement React Router DOM for handling navigation within the application, enabling smooth transitions between different views.

Redux: While Redux can be used for state management, useContext can be used as an alternative to manage application-level state efficiently, reducing the need for Redux.

Swiggy API Integration: Integrate the Swiggy API to fetch restaurant listings, menu details, user reviews, and other relevant data. Utilize useEffect hook for making asynchronous API requests and updating state accordingly.
